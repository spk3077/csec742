#Web Proxies Presentation

This project consists of the dependencies and the source code for detecting HTTP proxies Anonymity status (Anonymous or Elite)

httpproxy.py takes in a range of IP ranges (inclusively) and a port number. It is recommended to search a range around the presumed OpenProxy since there tends to be multiple surrounding proxies.
